Marketing team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. \nFrom these insights, we will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\nStakeholders:\n\n. Director of marketing\n\n.
